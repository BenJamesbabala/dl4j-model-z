# Model Configurations

This is a little different than a model zoo -- these are properly tuned neural network configurations that will learn well on data!

Existing models include:

- LeNet
- AlexNet
- VGGNetA
- VGGNetD
- CMGSNet
- Google LeNet (in progress on branch)
- OverFeat (in progress on a branch)
